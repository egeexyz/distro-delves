"We will utilize performance-driven trans-disciplinarity within the Zone of Proximity and implement competency-based presentations through the experiential based learning process as well as to operationalize competency-based multiple intelligences throughout multiple modalities without forgetting to revolutionize technology-enhanced processes outside the box."


"Our mission is to repurpose thematic models to close the achievement gap, orchestrating assessment-driven models to close said achievement gap and pooling flipped curriculum within a balanced literacy program with strengths-based cohorts within the Zone of Proximity."
