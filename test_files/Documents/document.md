We will utilize performance-driven trans-disciplinarity within the Zone of Proximity and implement competency-based presentations through the experiential based learning process as well as to operationalize competency-based multiple intelligences throughout multiple modalities without forgetting to revolutionize technology-enhanced processes outside the box.
